## 1. Overview

In this project, we created two systems: a server and a client application. The application is a weather app that allows users to view the weather forecast for any district capital in Portugal. Users can also add cities to a list of favorites for quicker access. The server is responsible for handling requests from the application by using an external API where the weather data is available.

To test the application, simply follow these steps:

-   In the server folder, run the following commands in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install
    node server.js
    ```
-   Then, in the app folder, run:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

It is important to note that before running the application, you need to define a `.env`, which must be inserted inside the `app/` folder.
You must define a variable `IP`, which will correspond to the IP of the machine where you will run the backend.
